# August-DSAConsistency

August Consistency Challenge: Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the August Consistency Challenge for Data Structures and Algorithms! This challenge aims to improve my problem-solving skills by solving three algorithmic questions daily, focused on various data structures. By participating in this challenge, I'll  strengthen my coding abilities, learn new data structures and algorithms, and make consistent progress throughout the month.


I will be doing this challenge throughout the month of August, and will solve three questions daily, for a total of 90 questions over the course of the month.
It's essential to be consistent. Even if I find some questions challenging, i will try best to solve them. The goal is to learn and improve your problem-solving skills.
Collaboration and learning from others are encouraged.
The primary goal is to challenge yourself and learn through your own efforts.

The questions i will cover will be from various topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.
Each day i will update the challenge in the "Challenges" directory of this repository. You can find the questions and my code for each day there.

Resources Used - 
LeetCode, Geeksforgeeks and strivers DSA A2Z sheet.


# Acknowledgments
This challenge was inspired by the need for consistent practice to master data structures and algorithms.
I accepted this challenge from lalit kumar's August DSA challenge and by 2nd or 3rd september i am supposed to submit the form.
